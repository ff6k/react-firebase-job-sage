				have gathered about individuals. We have therefore made arrangements to
				secure against unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,
				modification, disposal or destruction of personal information. These
				arrangements may include physical security measures, network security

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				1. Where an incident occurs involving the loss of or unauthorized access to
				or disclosure of personal information under our control, where a reasonable
				person would consider that there exists a real risk of significant harm to
				an individual as a result of the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure,
				we will, without unreasonable delay, provide notice to the Federal Trade

			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.title} variant="h6">REQUESTS FOR ACCESS</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				1. United States law permits individuals to submit written requests to us to
				provide them with:
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				1. access to their personal information under the custody or control of
				Jobsage
			</Typography>

			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">4. Requests for access are subject to the following:</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">1. Any requests must be in writing via post or email;</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				2. In order to receive a response to such a request, the individual must
				provide us with sufficient information to locate their record, if any, and
				to respond to them;
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				3. We will respond to requests in the time allowed by the laws of the United
				States
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				4. We will make a reasonable effort to assist applicants and to respond as
				accurately and completely as reasonably possible;

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				5. All requests may be subject to any fees and disbursements the law permits

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				6. Where appropriate to do so, we may require advance payment of a deposit

				information.
			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				2. Please note that an individual’s ability to access his or her personal
				information under our control is not an absolute right. United States law
				provides that Jobsage must not disclose personal information where:
			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				1. the disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety or
				physical or mental health of an individual other than the individual who
				made the request;
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				2. the disclosure would reveal personal information about another
				individual; or
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				3. the disclosure would reveal the identity of an individual who has in
				confidence provided us with an opinion about another individual and the
				individual providing the opinion does not consent to the disclosure of his
				or her identity.
			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				3. Certain United States laws also provide that Jobsage may choose not to
				disclose personal information where:
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">1. the personal information is protected by any legal privilege;</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				2. the disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial
				information and it is not unreasonable to withhold that information;
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				3. the personal information was collected by Jobsage for an investigation or
				legal proceeding;
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				4. the disclosure of the personal information might result in similar
				information no longer being provided to us when it is reasonable that it
				would be provided;

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				5. the personal information was collected or created by a mediator or

				was appointed to act

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">3. by a court.</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">

				prosecutorial discretion.
			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.title} variant="h6">RESPONSES TO REQUESTS</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				1. Our responses to requests for access to personal information will be in
				writing, and will confirm:
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">1. whether we are providing all or part of the requested information;</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">2. whether or not we are allowing access or providing copies; and</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">3. if access is being provided, when and how that will be given.</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				2. If access to information or copies are refused by us, we will provide
				written reasons for such refusal and the section of FOIA (the Freedom of
				Information Act) on which that refusal is based. We will also provide the
				name of an individual at Jobsage who can answer questions about the refusal,
				and particulars of how the requesting individual can ask the Information and
				Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or any other relevant Federal or State body
				of the United States to review our decision. In order to receive a response
				to such a request, the individual must provide us with sufficient
				information to locate their record, if any, and to respond to them.
			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.title} variant="h6">REQUEST FOR CORRECTION</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				1. Certain laws permit individuals to submit written requests to us to
				correct errors or omissions in their personal information that is in our
				custody or control. If an individual alleges errors or omissions in the
				personal information in our custody or control, we will either:
			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				1. correct the personal information and, if reasonable to do so, and if not
				contrary to law, send correction notifications to any other organizations to
				whom we disclosed the incorrect information; or
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				2. decide not to correct the personal information but annotate the personal
				information that a correction was requested but not made.
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				2. Corrections or amendments will rarely, if ever, be made to opinions,
				including expert or professional opinions, as opposed to factual
				information, which may be corrected if in error.
			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.title} variant="h6">AMENDMENT</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				1. Jobsage may amend this Policy from time to time as required and without
				notice, in order to better meet our obligations under the law.
			</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.title} variant="h6">DISPUTES</Typography>

			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body2">
				1. Governing Law and No Class Proceedings. The laws of the State of South
				Carolina, and the laws of United States applicable in South Carolina, will
				govern use of this Agreement and the interpretation, validity and effect of
				this Agreement, notwithstanding the parties’ physical location (whether
				permanent or temporary), residence or domicile. The parties agree to not
				commence any action by way of class proceedings, class action or any other
				claim involving court proceedings.
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				1. Arbitration: The Parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or
				controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement that are not
				resolved by their mutual agreement shall be submitted to final and binding
				arbitration before Arbitrator of the federal state or its successor,
				pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act of United States (FAA). Either Party
				may commence the arbitration process called for in this Agreement by filing
				a written demand for arbitration with ADR Chambers of United States, with a
				copy to the other Party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance
				with the provisions of ADR Chambers’ Arbitration Rules in effect at the time
				of filing of the demand for arbitration. The Parties will cooperate with ADR
				Chambers and with one another in selecting a single arbitrator from ADR
				Chambers’ panel of members, and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings.
				The Parties agree that they will participate in the arbitration in good
				faith. The provisions of this Section may be enforced by any Court of
				competent jurisdiction, and the Party seeking enforcement shall be entitled
				to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to
				be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered. The place of
				arbitration shall be Toronto, Ontario.
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				1. The arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the
				Federal Arbitration Act of United States (FAA). The arbitrator shall have
				the power to proceed with the arbitration and to deliver their award
				notwithstanding the default by any party in respect of any procedural order
				made by the arbitrator. It is further agreed that such arbitration shall be
				a condition precedent to the commencement of any action at law. The decision
				arrived at by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and no appeal shall
				lie therefrom. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
				entered in any court having jurisdiction.
			</Typography>
			<Typography className={classes.body} variant="body1">
				2. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
				neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited
				discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by
				courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can
				award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out
				of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract,
				tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and
				regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this
				Agreement.
